# `TxRegionsInput` â€” Supernatural text input

The `TxRegionsInput` component is a React text input component that can highlight sub-content based on built-in or custom markers and / or highlight invalid characters based on the built-in or custom validators. It ships with a variety of built-in markers and validators (e.g. URLs, email addresses, etc.). Custom markers and validators can be defined via `RegExp`s or string-parsing functions. DOM hooks are provided for styling based on the focus state and validity of the input.
